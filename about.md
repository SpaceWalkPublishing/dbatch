## A Somewhat Brief Autobiography

<p>
I was born in the United Kingdom and became a U.S. Citizen in 2018. Like so many people, I like to build things. Sometimes I rebuild things after purposefully taking them apart. Lego, trains, model 'planes, Space Marines, and cars are my favorite toys. I like finding out how things work. Experience is how I prefer to learn. I am always drawn to technical things, I really like to plan carefully, and science fiction is my genre.
</p>
<p>
From my teenage years I worked delivering newspapers, cleaning rooms at a retirement home, and helping out my father's company installing data networks. At the age of 16 I joined the British Territorial Army after spending many years in my school's cadet force. I qualified as a private infantry solider specializing in close target reconnaissance (quietly crawling through mud in the dark). I completed several Army Officer selection programs and was offered regimental sponsorship to attend the military academy at Sandhurst (I understand guns). However, despite military grandfathers and great grandfathers, of whom I am profoundly proud, I decided to postpone officer training and attend university.
</p>
<p>
I selected my major based on a career survey given at my school and attended The University of Hertfordshire (UH) 30 miles north of central London. At the time, UH was the only place offering the degree program the survey suggested I take: Astronomy. I had always been deeply interested in astronomy, as had my maternal grandfather, and having the army as a clear career path post-graduation I had nothing to lose by indulging that interest. As part of the degree I spent a year as a telescope operator on the Spanish owned Canary Islands, just off the coast of Morocco. This experience solidified my passion for the subject and gave me a deep connection with the beauty and fragility of our home planet, as well as our place within this universe.
</p>
<p>
The university learning environment suited me very well, and I completed my undergraduate degree with a near perfect grade point average. Two weeks before committing to officer training, I was offered a PhD position in astrophysics and realized I could have a different career path finding out how the Universe works. I now have a pretty good understanding of how the Universe works.

### Moving to the U.S.

  <p>
  In 2004 there were far more career opportunities for me in the U.S. compared to the U.K., and I took the opportunity to cross the Atlantic due to the success of my PhD advisor. He moved to upstate N.Y. to lead the Physics Department at Rochester Institute of Technology. I spent 6-years in Rochester, won several opportunities to use the Hubble Space Telescope, played quite a bit of rugby, made life-long friends, met my wife, and got all the professional experience I needed to successfully apply for a faculty position.

<p>
A faculty position at Florida Institute of Technology opened up in 2009, and we moved down in 2010. Capitalizing on the benefits of the Space Coast, I've been able to take my research in directions I never thought possible. Through a bit of good fortune some of that research was launched by SpaceX to the International Space Station, and will continue for many years.
</p>
<p>
Florida is an amazing place to live. It is always exciting; the space activities, the weather, the politics. I'm professionally keyed into the space activities, my family and I are prepared as best we can for the weather, and the politics are something I hope I can help with.
</p>
<p>
At the end of the day I think I can sit down and respectfully chat with anyone. I will listen, learn, and ask questions when necessary. I think we all have common ground to be found, and that we can all agree that children need special protection and attention, everyone deserves a chance at happiness, and that we shouldn't make where we live uninhabitable. The universe does a pretty good job of making itself uninhabitable; let's not help it.
