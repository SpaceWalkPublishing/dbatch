## A Little of My Background

<span class="image left" style="font-size: 70%"><img src="{{ "/images/pic04.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" />It was early morning, it was an exercise, and I couldn't resist snapping this picture shortly after I had exited this SH-3 Sea King.</span>
<p>
I was born in the United Kingdom and became a U.S. citizen in 2018. As a teenager I worked delivering newspapers, cleaning rooms at a retirement home, and helping my father's company install data networks. After spending many years in my school's cadet force, I joined the British Territorial Army. I qualified as a private infantry soldier specializing in close target reconnaissance (quietly crawling through mud in the dark) and completed a significant amount of weapons training. I attended several Army Officer selection programs and was offered regimental sponsorship to the military academy at Sandhurst. However, despite being profoundly proud of my military grandfathers and great grandfathers, I decided to postpone officer training and attend university.
</p>
<p>
I selected my astronomy major based on a career survey given at my school and attended The University of Hertfordshire 30 miles north of central London. I had always been deeply interested in astronomy and having the army as a clear post-graduation career path meant I had nothing to lose by indulging that interest. As part of my degree I spent a year as a telescope operator in the Canary Islands. This experience showed me our place in this universe and connected me with the beauty and fragility of our home planet.
</p>
<p>
Two weeks before committing to officer training, I was offered a Ph.D. position in astrophysics and realized I could have a career path finding out how this universe works.

### Moving to the U.S.

  <p>
  In 2004, there were many more career opportunities for me in the U.S. than in the U.K., and I followed my Ph.D. advisor to upstate New York, where he led the Physics Department at Rochester Institute of Technology. I spent six years in Rochester, where I won several opportunities to use the Hubble Space Telescope, played quite a bit of rugby, made life-long friends, and met my wife.

My wife and I moved to the Sunshine State in 2010 for a faculty position at Florida Institute of Technology. Capitalizing on the benefits of the Space Coast, I've been able to take my research in directions I never thought possible. Some of that research was launched by SpaceX to the International Space Station.
</p>
<p>
However, after spending 10-years working for a small private university, mostly as an administrator, it was time to move back to full-time research. Being so close to the John F. Kennedy Space Center, at such a productive spacetime in human history, presented an opportunity too exciting to pass up. In the summer of 2020, while the world reeled from a global pandemic, but while we once again launched a crew to the space station and sent another rover to Mars, I began working as a NASA contractor in a Subject Matter Expert position.
</p>
<p>
Florida is always exciting&mdash;the space activities, the weather, the politics. I'm professionally keyed into the space activities, my family and I are prepared as best we can for the weather, and the politics are something I hope I can help with.
</p>
<p>
At the end of the day I think I can sit down and respectfully chat with anyone. I will listen, learn, and ask questions when necessary. I think we all share common ground. We can all agree children need special protection and attention, that everyone deserves a chance at happiness, and that we shouldn't make our planet uninhabitable.
