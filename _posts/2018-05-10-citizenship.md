## Born in the U.K., Living in the U.S.
<p>
In times like these it is easy to wonder what would motivate a person to become a U.S. Citizen. And, admittedly, with all that we’re going through it is easy to forget all that we have and all that we’ve achieved.
</p>
<p>
It is often forgot that we have a powerful Constitution constructed in order "to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty.” It is also often forgot that this same Constitution dictates congress to “promote the progress of science”, and over the last few centuries what progress we have seen and made.
</p>
<p>
Since 1787, we have supported some of the best scientific minds in the history of our species and achieved technological feats unimaginable to our ancestors. From Benjamin Franklin to Elon Musk, through Einstein, Fermi, Oppenheimer, and Feynman, citizens of the United States have broken through scientific and technological boundaries, shown us the fabric of our universe, and given us a euphoric vision of our future. We have placed powerful computers in our pockets, walked on the Moon, and decoded the very structure of our existence. And this is why I chose to become a United States citizen.
</p>
<p>
And yet, many of our species seem unable to grasp the basics of reason that science has shown us. Blinded to the follies of fossil fuels, ignorant to the impact of unregulated armaments, and oblivious to the need for an excellent education system, it seems easy to destroy our dreams, trample on our delicate planet, and suffocate the rights of all but a privileged few.
</p>
<p>
We must do everything we can to restore scientific literacy to the majority. We must fight to restore the shine lost from that city on the hill, and revive our country to an example that resonates around the world. And this is why I chose to become a United States citizen.
</p>
<p>
We must commit ourselves, one and all, to make a difference. We must be courageous. We must vote. We must speak. We must volunteer our time. We must find the common ground and guide those struggling to understand the perils of a scientifically illiterate society. And, most importantly, we must strongly support anyone we know that will make the right difference.
</p>
<p>
These tasks are not easy; they are hard. But they are also, like the progress of those that have come before us, achievable and necessary.
</p>
### The Place for Space
<p>
In April 2019, we witnessed the launch of our next step on the path of progress. The TESS mission, riding atop another of Musk’s Falcons, is the latest of an ever-increasing lineage of space telescope that have shown us the incredible societal impact of space and science exploration. From Hipparcos to Newton, Spitzer and Kepler, space telescopes frequently bear the names of great scientists that have changed our cosmic perspective.
</p>
<p>
Proudly leading these orbiting observatories has been the Hubble Space Telescope. Hubble is an incredible example of the human spirit. For over a quarter century, it has beaten the odds and gone on to change what it means to be human. Through the love, talent, and perseverance of teams of engineers and scientists, Hubble has witnessed catastrophic cosmic collisions, the paths of planets around other stars, and the pillars of chemical creation. It told us the very age of our universe itself. The jaw-dropping natural beauty of images returned by Hubble has inspired generations of engineers and scientists to become part of the path of human progress. It has shown us that we are desperately insignificant beings on a fragile planet existing but for a blink in cosmic history. So what will you do with your blink?
</p>
<p>
We must use the awe of science to overhaul our species appreciation for life. We must spread the significance of science and how it impacts our lives. It extends us, saves us, and gives us the opportunity to make ourselves, and each other, comfortable, fulfilled, and happy.
</p>
<p>
As we March ever toward a more perfect union, we must demand that science drives policy: Policies based on evidence and not the deep pockets of special interests; policies based on liberty and justice for all, and not forced from a bigoted oligarchy; policies that protect our future, our children’s future, and the future of our planet; policies not sold out to greedy corporations choking our environment and holding our health hostage.
</p>
<p>
And so, once begin to turn the tide of anti-intellectualism, we must overhaul our education system to unashamedly include scientifically progressive curricula. Imagine a country filled with critical thinkers. Imagine a country filled with voters immune to logical fallacies. Imagine a country bursting with cosmic humility and numeracy. Imagine a country where science leads the way and ensures we can all live long and prosper.
</p>
<p>
This is why I am a scientist, and this is why I chose to become a United States citizen.

### The Process
I submitted the N-400 paperwork to petition for Citizenship on October 31st, 2017. I had been working in the U.S. since 2004. My path to citizenship began with the J-1 and H1-B VISAs before a greencard supported by my wife. My Naturalization ceremony was on May 10th, 2018. The above blog post is adapted from a speech I gave at the 2018 March for Science in Orlando, Florida.
